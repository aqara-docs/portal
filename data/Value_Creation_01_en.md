VALUE CREATION
Make something people want . . . There’s nothing more valuable
than an unmet need that is just becoming fixable. If you find
something broken that you can fix for a lot of people, you’ve
found a gold mine.
—PAUL GRAHAM, FOUNDER OF Y COMBINATOR, VENTURE CAPITALIST, AND ESSAYIST AT
PAULGRAHAM.COM
Every successful business creates something of value. The world is full of
opportunities to make other people’s lives better in some way, and your job
as a businessperson is to identify things that people don’t have enough of,
then find a way to provide them.
The value you create can take on one of several different forms, but the
purpose is always the same: to make someone else’s life a little bit better.
Without value creation, a business can’t exist—you can’t transact with
others unless you have something valuable to trade.
The best businesses in the world are the ones that create the most value
for other people. Some businesses thrive by providing a little value to many,
and others focus on providing a lot of value to only a few people.
Regardless, the more real value you create for other people, the better your
business will be and the more prosperous you’ll become.

The Five Parts of Every Business
A business is a repeatable process that makes money. Everything
else is a hobby.
—PAUL FREET, SERIAL ENTREPRENEUR AND COMMERCIALIZATION EXPERT
Roughly defined, a business is a repeatable process that:
1. Creates and delivers something of value . . .
2. That other people want or need . . .
3. At a price they’re willing to pay . . .
4. In a way that satisfies the customer’s needs and expectations . .
.
5. So that the business brings in enough profit to make it
worthwhile for the owners to continue operation.
It doesn’t matter if you’re running a solo venture or a billion-dollar
brand. Take any one of these five factors away, and you don’t have a
business—you have something else. A venture that doesn’t create value for
others is a hobby. A venture that doesn’t attract attention is a flop. A
venture that doesn’t sell the value it creates is a nonprofit. A venture that
doesn’t deliver what it promises is a scam. A venture that doesn’t bring in
enough money to keep operating will inevitably close.
At the core, every business is fundamentally a collection of five
Interdependent (discussed later) processes, each of which flows into the
next:
1. Value Creation. Discovering what people need or want, then
creating it.
2. Marketing. Attracting attention and building demand for what
you’ve created.
3. Sales. Turning prospective customers into paying customers.
4. Value Delivery. Giving your customers what you’ve promised
and ensuring that they’re satisfied.
5. Finance. Bringing in enough money to keep going and make
your effort worthwhile.
If these five things sound simple, it’s because they are. Business is not
(and has never been) rocket science—it’s simply a process of identifying a
problem and finding a way to solve it that benefits both parties. Anyone
who tries to make business sound more complicated than this is either
trying to impress you or trying to sell you something you don’t need.
The Five Parts of Every Business are the basis of every good business
idea and business plan. If you can clearly define each of these five
processes for any business, you’ll have a complete understanding of how it
works. If you’re thinking about starting a new business, defining what these
processes might look like is the best place to start. If you can’t describe or
diagram your business idea in terms of these core processes, you don’t
understand it well enough to make it work.1

Economically Valuable Skills
Don’t go around saying the world owes you a living. The world
owes you nothing—it was here first.
—MARK TWAIN, GREAT AMERICAN NOVELIST
If you want to improve your value as a businessperson, focus on improving
skills directly related to the Five Parts of Every Business.
Not every skill or area of knowledge is Economically Valuable, and
that’s okay—there are many things worth pursuing for the sake of
relaxation or enjoyment alone. You may enjoy whitewater rafting, but it’s
very unlikely anyone will pay you to shoot the rapids unless you apply your
skills for the benefit of others. Make the leap from personal enjoyment to
Products and Services (discussed later), however, and you’ll find yourself
getting paid—plenty of adventurous souls are willing to pay for rafting
equipment and guides.
As Michael Masterson suggests in Ready, Fire, Aim, don’t expect skills
that aren’t related to the Five Parts of Every Business to be economically
rewarded. Find a way to use them to create Economic Value, and you’ll
inevitably find a way to get paid.
Any skill or knowledge that helps you create value, market, sell, deliver
value, or manage finances is Economically Valuable—accordingly, these
are the topics we’ll discuss in this book.

The Iron Law of the Market
Market matters most; neither a stellar team nor fantastic product
will redeem a bad market. Markets that don’t exist don’t care how
smart you are.
—MARC ANDREESSEN, VENTURE CAPITALIST AND FOUNDER OF NETSCAPE AND
NING.COM
What if you throw a party and nobody shows up? In business, it happens all
the time.
Dean Kamen, a renowned and prolific inventor whose creations include
the Sterling engine, the world’s first insulin pump, and water purification
devices, poured over $100 million into the development of the Segway PT,
a $5,000, two-wheeled, self-balancing scooter that he claimed would
revolutionize personal transportation “in the same way that the car replaced
the horse and buggy.” When the Segway was made available to the public
in 2002, the company announced that it expected to sell 50,000 units every
year.
Five years into the business, the company had sold a total of 23,000 units
—less than 10 percent of the initial goal. (The company’s financial records
are private, but it’s safe to say they don’t look good.)
The problem wasn’t that the product was poorly designed—the
technology that makes the Segway work is extremely sophisticated, and the
benefits are significant: the Segway is a convenient, green urban car
replacement. The problem was that very few people cared enough to spend
$5,000 on a goofy-looking alternative to walking or riding a bike—the
massive market that Kamen expected didn’t exist.
The same thing happens to new businesses every day. Without enough
revenue to sustain it, any business will fail. Your revenue is completely
dependent on people actually wanting what you have to offer.
Every business is fundamentally limited by the size and quality of the
market it attempts to serve. The Iron Law of the Market is cold, hard, and
unforgiving: if you don’t have a large group of people who really want what
you have to offer, your chances of building a viable business are very slim.
The best approach is to focus on making things people want to buy.
Creating something no one wants is a waste. Market research is the business
equivalent of “look before you leap.” Books like The New Business Road
Test by John Mullins can help you identify promising markets from the
outset, increasing the probability that your new venture will be a success.
In the next few sections, we’ll explore how to figure out what people
want and need before investing your time and hard-earned money into
creating something new.

Core Human Drives
Understanding human needs is half the job of meeting them.
—ADLAI STEVENSON, POLITICIAN AND FORMER GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS
If you’re going to build a successful business, it’s useful to have a basic
understanding of what people want. According to Harvard Business School
professors Paul Lawrence and Nitin Nohria, the authors of Driven: How
Human Nature Shapes Our Choices, all human beings have four Core
Human Drives that have a profound influence on our decisions and actions:
1. The Drive to Acquire. The desire to obtain or collect physical
objects, as well as immaterial qualities like status, power, and
influence. Businesses built on the drive to acquire include
retailers, investment brokerages, and political consulting
companies. Companies that promise to make us wealthy, famous,
influential, or powerful connect to this drive.
2. The Drive to Bond. The desire to feel valued and loved by
forming relationships with others, either platonic or romantic.
Businesses built on the drive to bond include restaurants,
conferences, and dating services. Companies that promise to
make us attractive, well liked, or highly regarded connect to this
drive.
3. The Drive to Learn. The desire to satisfy our curiosity.
Businesses built on the drive to learn include academic programs,
book publishers, and training workshops. Companies that promise
to make us more knowledgeable or competent connect to this
drive.
4. The Drive to Defend. The desire to protect ourselves, our loved
ones, and our property. Businesses built on the drive to defend
include home alarm systems, insurance products, martial arts
training, and legal services. Companies that promise to keep us
safe, eliminate a problem, or prevent bad things from happening
connect to this drive.
There’s a fifth core drive that Lawrence and Nohria missed:
5. The Drive to Feel. The desire for new sensory stimulus, intense
emotional experiences, pleasure, excitement, entertainment, and
anticipation. Businesses built on the drive to feel include
restaurants, movies, games, concerts, and sporting events. Offers
that promise to give us pleasure, thrill us, or give us something to
look forward to connect with this drive.
Whenever a group of people have an unmet need in one or more of these
areas, a market will form to satisfy that need. As a result, the more drives
your offer connects with, the more attractive it will be to your potential
market.
At the core, all successful businesses sell some combination of money,
status, power, love, knowledge, protection, pleasure, and excitement. The
more clearly you articulate how your product satisfies one or more of these
drives, the more attractive your offer will become.
